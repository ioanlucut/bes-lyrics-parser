[v1]
There’s always something
In the way
There’s always something
Getting through
But it’s not me
It’s You, it’s You

[c]
Sometimes ignorance
Rings true
But hope is not in
What i know
It’s not in me..me
It’s in You, it’s in You

[b]
It’s all i know
It’s all i know
It’s all i know
It’s all i know
It’s all i know
It’s all i know
In You
In You
Its in You
Its in You

[v2]
I find peace when
I’m confused
I find hope when
I’m let down
Not in me... Me
In You
It’s in you

[v3]
I hope to lose myself
For good
I hope to find it in the end
Not in me... Me
In You
In You
In You

[e]
There’s always something in the way
There’s always something getting through
But it’s not me
It’s You
It’s You
It’s You....
