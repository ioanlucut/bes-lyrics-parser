[v1]
Let your light so shine that the world may see
How to come to Christ who will set them free;
Let its rays gleam bright when the darkness falls,
Till each sinful soul for the Savior calls.

[c]
Let your light shine, let your light shine,
Let your light so shine before men;
That they your works beholding, that they your works beholding,
May glorify the Father’s name in heav’n.

[v2]
Let your light so shine everywhere you go,
Till the tribes of earth Jesus Christ may know;
Let its rays transpose into perfect day,
When the clouds of gloom shall be swept away.

[v3]
Let your light so shine that its beams may reach
Every darkened soul, thus the gospel preach;
Let it brighter shine till that endless day,
Bursts upon our sight ne’er to pass away.

[v4]
Let your light so shine every day and hour,
That the truth be clothed with divinest pow’r;
Let it brightly shine and promote God’s cause,
To exalt His name and His holy law.
