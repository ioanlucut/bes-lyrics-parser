[v1]
Keep me near Thee, blessed Jesus,
Keep me near Thee lest I stray;
With Thy mighty hand uphold me,
Lead me gently all the way.

[c]
/: Life without Thee would be dreary,
Cheerless all my path would be;
But while walking in Thy presence,
Heaven’s glory shines on me. :/

[v2]
Keep me near Thee, precious Savior,
Many snares are by the way;
’
Neath Thy balmy wings protect me,
Draw me nearer Thee each day.

[v3]
Help me live so near Thee, Jesus,
That Thy whispers I may hear,
Let me feel Thy arms around me
When the hand of danger’s near.

[v4]
Draw me nearer, blessed Jesus,
Closely fold me to Thy breast;
Pillowed on Thy loving bosom,
Let me ever sweetly rest.
