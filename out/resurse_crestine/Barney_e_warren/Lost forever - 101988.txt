[v1]
Where is thy hope, poor sinner?
What are you going to do?
Hope is a God-given anchor,
Lavished so freely on you;
If it is fixed in the Savior,
On that bright shore you will land,
But if in sin you still linger,
Sad your end.

[c]
Lost, forever! Lost, forever!
Oh, how sad!

[v2]
Where is thy refuge, sinner?
Look where your pathway will end;
Repent, or you’ll perish forever,
Awful destruction’s at hand;
Heaven or hell you are choosing,
Fixing and sealing your fate,
God and His mercy refusing,
Lost! Too late!

[v3]
What can you plead, poor sinner,
In the great judgment day?
Heaven now offers you favor,
Oh, do not cast it away;
Slighted the warnings repeated,
Leave you in Satan’s control;
And with all heaven rejected,
Lost, your soul.

[v4]
Where will you go, poor sinner?
How will your soul escape?
Think of thy lot, when, forever,
Cast in the dark, burning lake;
If then you’re lost and forgotten,
Writhing in flames of despair,
You will remember you’ve chosen
To be there.
