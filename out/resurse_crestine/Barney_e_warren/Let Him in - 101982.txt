[v1]
Who is knocking at your heart today?
Let the Savior in;
Sinner, do not grieve the Lord away,
Will you let Him in?

[c]
Let Him in, let Him in,
Sinner, rise, let Him in.

[v2]
He is ling’ring at the closed door,
Let the Savior in;
You have heard Him knocking o’er and o’er,
Will you let Him in?

[v3]
He has long protected you from death,
Let the Savior in;
Don’t refuse the Lord who gives you breath,
Will you let Him in?

[v4]
On the cross His blood was shed so free,
Let the Savior in;
Do not let your will thus dormant be,
Will you let Him in?

[v5]
Is your heart now like the granite stone?
Let the Savior in;
Soon His blood for you will not atone,
Will you let Him in?
