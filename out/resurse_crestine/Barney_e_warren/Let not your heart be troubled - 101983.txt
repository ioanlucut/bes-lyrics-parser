[v1]
Let not your weary heart be troubled,
Believe in God, believe in Me;
For in My Father’s house are mansions,
I will prepare a place for thee.

[c]
Let not your heart be troubled,
Let not your heart be troubled;
Let not your heart be troubled,
Nor let it be afraid.

[v2]
Let not your peace in calm assurance
Be ruffled by the storms of life;
But soldier-like, with firm endurance,
Just glory in the holy strife.

[v3]
Let not your hope be dimmed with doubting,
Let not life’s burdens foil your grace;
But in each conflict vict’ry shouting,
Like he who runs to win a race.
