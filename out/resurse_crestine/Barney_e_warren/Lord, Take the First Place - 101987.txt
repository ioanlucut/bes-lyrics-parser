v1,c,v2,c,v3,c,v4,c

[v1]
I yield to Thee, Savior, forsaking my all,
From sinful things now I will part;
To Thee I surrender, for mercy I call,
Come, take the first place in my heart.

[c]
Oh, take the first place in my heart,
Oh, take the first place in my heart;
I open the door, come in, I implore;
Lord, take the first place in my heart.

[v2]
Oh, come, gentle Spirit, donâ€™t leave me, I pray,
From Thee I will never depart;
I come to Thee now, for I cannot delay,
Lord, take the first place in my heart.

[v3]
I cannot be lost, Lord, for Thee I will live,
Forgiveness, O Savior, impart;
If I will confess, Thou wilt freely forgive,
And take the first place in my heart.

[v4]
The joybells of heaven will ring in my soul,
My Savior, Redeemer, Thou art;
To Thee I surrender, wilt Thou make me whole?
Take now the first place in my heart.
