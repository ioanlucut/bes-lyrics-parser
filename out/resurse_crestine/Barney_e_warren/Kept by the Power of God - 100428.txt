[v1]
We are kept by the power and favor of God
From all the dominion of sin;
He cleanseth by faith in His own precious blood,
His spirit is reigning within.

[c]
We are kept by the power of God,
We are kept by the power of God;
By trusting, obeying,
By watching and praying,
We are kept by the power of God.

[v2]
We are kept by the power of God through faith
So long as we walk in the light;
Our helper is Jesus who faithfully saith,
„
I’m with you by day and by night.”

[v3]
We are kept by the power of God if we trust,
We never need faint by the way;
Then do as He bids you, His counsel is just,
Be humble, be watchful, and pray.

[v4]
We are kept by the power of God each day,
The story of grace we’ll repeat;
Through Him we are conquerors if we obey,
The foe we will ever defeat.
