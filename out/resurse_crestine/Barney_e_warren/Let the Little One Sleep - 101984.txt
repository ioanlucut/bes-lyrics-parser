[v1]
That little form before us
In death’s embrace,
Sweet angel face,
Has left a vacant place.

[c]
Let the little one sleep,
Let the little one sleep,
It is free from this world of care;
The Master has come,
And called it home,
It is resting over there.

[v2]
Our darling child is sleeping,
It’s left this shore,
Forevermore,
Its suff’ring days are o’er.

[v3]
Our little one is living
Among the blest
In sweeter rest;
Our Father knoweth best.

[v4]
Our child has gone to glory;
Let us prepare
To meet it there,
Eternal bliss to share.
