v1,c,v2,c

[v1]
Pain and grief and poverty still in
Bitterness and anxiety, the sin
Draw me down in the mud again;
Darkness and the lonelieness brake in
In my heart now I’m a part from Him
I am crawling and I fell the shame;
But I find His hand again.

/: Carry me through,
Jesus. :/ x6

[v2]
I can fell the heavy chain on me
I am cold and shuddering: Oh Je’
I am crying: Jesus save, save me!
Then a love I never felt before
Lifts me up and give me strenght and more
Then I hear: I’ll never let you go!
I thank you my sweet Jesus for making me
hole!
