So faithful in the world below {author: {Iulia Contis}, {rcId: {244589}}

v1,v2

[v1]
I am a pilgrim in this world;
The twilight whispers just a word...
My treasure that I have in Him
Will last forever! He has been
So faithful in the world below!
Through years of pain, all that I know
Is that the devil proved to be
Less powerful than God can be!

[v2]
The background, in my dream, I thought
Will put him out, but he is not
As gentle as he seems to be...
My vision blossoms and I see
All those strange movements he made then...
They’re almost tangible, but when
I see the monumental cross,
I’m glad God never has a loss!
