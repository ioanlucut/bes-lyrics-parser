[v1]
The accursed clay whispers a song
That takes my breath away; it’s long!
The lily of the valley is away...
And, oh, the world is going now astray...

[c]
My anguish, if you take me to the King,
My desperate cry only to Him I’ll bring!

[v2]
This poor old song will make me cry!
I see God’s cleft and that big ”why?”;
I see the empty tomb and I can sing,
To God my worried heart now I can bring!
