v1,c,v2,c

[v1]
I do not belong to this world;
Even though I know every bird
Has its song, I feel that, on high,
You’re my God! You’ll hear my sigh!

[c]
/I belong to You! / x3

[v2]
You’ll be through the storms of my life
My pure God and when our pride
Will come out from the sinful soul,
You’ll forgive us, making us whole!
