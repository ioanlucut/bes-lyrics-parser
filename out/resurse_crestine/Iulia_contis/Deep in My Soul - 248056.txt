Deep in my soul {composer: {Iulia Contis}, {rcId: {248056}}

[sequence]
v1,v2,v3

[v1]
Through many trials I have been...
I wanted to escape, but sin
Was present in my dirty soul...
I thought: Without You, I will fall!

[v2]
I want to dig into my mind...
I was alone, but You were kind...
This vivid picture will remain
Deep in my soul; it’s not in vain!

[v3]
You’re kind to me in the lost world...
Temptation lost all in the word...
All that is painful is transformed,
’
Cause all that I am You have formed!
