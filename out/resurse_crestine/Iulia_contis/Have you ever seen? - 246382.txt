[v1]
Have you ever been
In such a pain like His?
Have you ever seen
His words on His pure lips?

[c]
With a sinless life,
He cannot lie to you.
Here you have the view!
He gives you eternal life!

[v2]
Have you ever thought
That on the cross He’ll die?
He is God! He’ll not
Hurt you! He’ll not lie!
