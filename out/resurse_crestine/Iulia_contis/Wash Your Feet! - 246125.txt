[sequence]
v1,c,v2,c

[v1]
When the devil comes near the cross,
Let us find the face of our Lord!
Spend the night with the beautiful Word!
Let us cry out to God in the loss!

[c]
Just under the shadow of His roof,
Shutting the door that is behind you,
You will have the most beautiful view!
Enter His house with songs, not with proof!

[v2]
Wash your feet and the angel of God
Will appear on the holy ground!
I tell you: just in Him I have found
How to live by the strength of the blood!
