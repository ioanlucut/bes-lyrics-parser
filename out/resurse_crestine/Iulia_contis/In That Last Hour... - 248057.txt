[v1]
I will embrace Your calling;
To You now I am coming!
You are my strong desire!
Your word is like a/ the fire!

[c]
When You were on the cross,
I knew You were the most
Beautiful god on earth
And, then, You gave me birth!

[v2]
In jeopardy my soul was,
Iâ€™m singing in my pure verse... ;
But Your tremendous power
Saved me in that last hour...
