[sequence]
v1,c,v2,c

[v1]
Protected by the blood of Jesus,
Knowing that through all the sorrows
You will be God, I will not fall!
Only in You will live my soul!

[c]
I want to see You in Your splendour;
I’ll take my cross I have to bear!

[v2]
I’m not afraid of the nude darkness,
’
Cause You’re my Light! In loneliness,
Today I will lift up my eyes...
I’m here, but my soul still cries!
