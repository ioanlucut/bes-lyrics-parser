v1,v2

[v1]
I hear Your voice in our crazy world
And I can see You in the divine word!
Today Your Holy Spirit leads my life;
Here You are, present in every strife!

[v2]
I hear Your steps; Youâ€™ll come to help us when,
Deep in our souls, we will find You and then,
Through our suffering, we will proclaim
That You are God and Your thruth we will claim!
