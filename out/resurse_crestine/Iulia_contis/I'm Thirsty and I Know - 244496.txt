v1,v2,v3,v4,v5,v6

[v1]
Today the rays will shine!
Each one of them is mine...
I want to soar to sky,
To see my God on high!

[v2]
I see the sprout on earth
As green as natural birth;
I don’t forget the Word
That seems to be a sword...

[v3]
I’m thirsty and I know
He will come from below;
I will transcend our time,
Because God will be mine!

[v4]
My unabated soul
The Spirit will uphold!
The vengeful nature
Will be forever pure!

[v5]
Let us transpose the song
While people will still long
For withered weeds on earth!
The heaven gives us birth...

[v6]
And every wound His will
Will clean, because He’s still
In the midst of the storm!
Take heart and take His form!
