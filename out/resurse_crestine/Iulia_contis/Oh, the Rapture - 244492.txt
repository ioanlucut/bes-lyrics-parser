[sequence]
v1,c,v2,c

[v1]
In a manger full of rust,
In a world lost in its lust,
Through the peril, as a child
My God came right from on high!

[c]
We can all have that relief
When we long for it in peace!

[v2]
Oh, the rapture of the saints
That were then on earth still paints
Our picker of our soul,
â€™
Cause that was a heavenly role!
