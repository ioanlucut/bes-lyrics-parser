[sequence]
v1,v2,v3

[v1]
Chorus You’re the one we adore,
You are the Creator!
We bow our knees today,
Because this is the day
/When you came down to earth! / x2

[v2]
You were God and today
You’re still God and we pray;
We remember the day
Written without delay...

[v3]
Only for You we sing
And we come and we bring
Our hearts to You, king,
Despite our world’s wind!
