[sequence]
v1,v2

[v1]
Looking around, the darkness is all that I see...
From time to time, a light appears suddenly...
The open gates of heaven! The Spirit of God
Enlightens me; despite the mist, I have to nod!

[v2]
The river of God, in the midst of the garden,
Still writes through the cross the history of heaven!
Come down, oh, my God, in the midst of the water!
Come down! Donâ€™t let the evil one hit or flatter!
