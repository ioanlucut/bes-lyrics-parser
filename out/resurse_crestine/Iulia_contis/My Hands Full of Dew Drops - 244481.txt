My hands full of dew drops {author: {Iulia Contis}, {rcId: {244481}}

[sequence]
v1,v2

[v1]
The smell of the incense that covers the path
Is not burned for the glory of our God!
A strange god appeared and I am so sad!
I saw through my old gaze that footprint, I thought.

[v2]
My hands full of dew drops I lift to the sky
And, looking around, all I see is the grave...
Oh, heal my soul, God, â€™cause I know that on high
You work for Your purpose and only You save!
