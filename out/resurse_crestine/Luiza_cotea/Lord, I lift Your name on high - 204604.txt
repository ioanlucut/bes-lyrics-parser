In the morning I hear You calling
’
Talk with Me and be still.
Take My peace, take My love,
Calm your soul and be free’

[b]
You gave me hope
You took my sorrow
You loved me as I am
That’s why I can sing
Of Your great love
Through Your mercy now I see

The Lord will fight for me
I only need to be still.’ Exodus 14:14

Lord I lift Your name on high
Every ocean will run dry
With Your love
Every second of my life
You are keeping me alive
With Your love
Lord I lift Your name on high
Every ocean will run dry
With Your love
Every second of my life
You are keeping me alive
With Your love
