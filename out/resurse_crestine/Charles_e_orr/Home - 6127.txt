[v1]
Oh, home of my soul
In that far away goal,
Each day brings me nearer to thee;
The great throne so white,
And my crown shining bright,
Mine eyes ever longing to see.

[v2]
A musical strain
From that far distant plain
Now sweeps gently over my soul;
And waves of sweet peace
In my heart shall increase,
While years of eternity roll.

[v3]
The day will soon come
When weâ€™ll all gather home,
As pilgrims no more we shall roam;
Ah, whom shall we see?
And what joy will it be
To meet with the dear ones at home!
