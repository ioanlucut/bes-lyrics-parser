[v1]
When the sun of your life has gone down,
And the clouds in the west turn to gold,
Endless death will to you then have come,
If the light has gone out in your soul.

[c]
Oh, just think how in death you would feel,
With the light growing dim in your soul;
Oh, how lonely ’twill be, oh, how still!
If the light has gone out in your soul.

[v2]
When you come to the end of the way,
And life’s story for you has been told,
Oh, how sad all to you will appear
If the light has gone out in your soul.

[v3]
When the chill winds of death ’round you steal,
And the sweat on your brow’s damp and cold,
What a dread in your life you would feel,
If the light has gone out in your soul.

[v4]
When before judgment’s bar you shall stand,
And the deeds of your life have been told,
Good and evil appears, oh, what then,
If the light has gone out in your soul?
