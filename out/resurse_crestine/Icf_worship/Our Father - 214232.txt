Our father in heaven, Your name lives forever
Your kingdom shall come down and Your will be done
You are our provider, You know what we need and
Forgive us our failures as we will forgive

We pray for open heavens
Come fill this place with Your presence
We pray for open heavens
We’re ready for You, we’re ready for You

Keep out all temptation and free us from evil
You are the redeemer, our saviour in need
For Yours is the kingdom and Yours is the power
Yours is the glory, this we believe

We believe, we believe
We believe, in the love of our father
