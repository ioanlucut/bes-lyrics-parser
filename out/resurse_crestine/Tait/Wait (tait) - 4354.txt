[v1]
Looking out my front door
I see a frantic world desperate for more
Quick fix at your fingertips
The longer it takes the harder it gets

[c]
But I’ll wait for You
To give me everything I need
I’m gonna wait for You
You make my life complete
Yeah, You know You do

[v2]
We want it all and we want it now
Caught in a high speed chase, can’t slow down
Headed for a panic attack
I gotta get off this one way track

[c2]
So I’ll wait for You
To give me everything I need
I’m gonna wait for You
You make my life complete

[b]
I’m gonna wait wait wait for You
Cause you’re the perfect one for me
I’m gonna wait wait wait for You
Oh yeah
Wait for You to give me everything I need
I’m gonna wait wait wait for You
Ooh You make my life complete

[v3]
I know You see the deepest part of me
But still Your love for me is a mystery

[e]
To give me everything I need
I’m gonna wait wait wait for You
God You make my life complete, yeah
I’m gonna wait for You
Oh yeah
