v1,v2,b,c,v3,c,e

[v1]
I’ve been here before
It’s hard to ignore
I’m so used to fighting
The same old wars

[v2]
Oh what do you see when your looking at me
Have I taken You for granted
I can’t afford this pain anymore
Won’t You help me understand it

[b]
God can You hear me
I need You here tonight
I’m tired of pretending that everything’s alright
And I know, I know that You hold tomorrow
But I need You here tonight

[c]
I want to feel
I need something real
I want to go closer to You
I lay down my will

[v3]
Oh this human disease it’s killing me
Tell me have I been left stranded
I can’t ignore this pain anymore
Won’t You help me understand it

[e]
Say won’t You say that
You’ll carry me
Carry me through the storm
Stay
Won’t You stay
Till the morning comes
Morning comes
Just stay
