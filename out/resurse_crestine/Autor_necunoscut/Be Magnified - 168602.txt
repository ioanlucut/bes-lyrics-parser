[sequence]
v1,c,v2,c

[v1]
I have made You too small in my eyes
O Lord, forgive me;
And I have believed in a lie
That You were unable to help me.
But now, O Lord, I see my wrong
Heal my heart and show Yourself strong;
And in my eyes and with my song
/: O Lord, be magnified! :/

[c]
Be magnified, O Lord
You are highly exalted;
And there is nothing You canâ€™t do
O Lord, my eyes are on You.
Be magnified,
O Lord, be magnified.

[v2]
I have leaned on the wisdom of men
O Lord, forgive me;
And I have responded to them
Instead of Your light and Your mercy.
But now, O Lord, I see my wrong
Heal my heart and show Yourself strong;
And in my eyes with my song
/: O Lord, be magnified! :/
