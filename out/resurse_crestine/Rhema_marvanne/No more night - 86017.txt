v1,c,v2,c,v3,c,e

[v1]
The timeless theme, Earth and Heaven will pass away.
It’s not a dream, God will make all things new that day.
Gone is the curse from which I stumbled and fell.
Evil is banished to eternal hell.

[c]
No more night. No more pain.
No more tears. Never crying again.
And praises to the great ”
I AM.”
We will live in the light of the risen Lamb.

[v2]
See all around, now the nations bow down to sing.
The only sound is the praises to Christ, our King.
Slowly the names from the book are read.
I know the King, so there’s no need to dread.

[v3]
See over there, there’s a mansion,
Oh, that’s prepared just for me,
Where I will live
With my savior eternally.

[e]
All praises to the great ”
I AM.”
We’re gonna live in the light of the risen Lamb.
