[v1]
Dear Lord,
I’m on my knees again
I come to you because you understand.
I’ve tried so hard, but I just can’t change myself
That’s why I know I need your help.

[c]
So here I am, this is my plea,
My only hope is your love for me.
I’m reaching out so desperately.
Come take my hand, take all of me, just as I am.

[v2]
Oh Lord you made what’s broken new.
Why can’t I learn, to follow you?
I want to know you, to feel you in my soul, I surrender all control.

[e]
I am not afraid to follow you where you lead me
I can leave the past behind me.
I’m forgiven, and I’m free
My only hope is your love for me.
I’m reaching out so desperately.
Come take my hand, take all of me, just as I am
