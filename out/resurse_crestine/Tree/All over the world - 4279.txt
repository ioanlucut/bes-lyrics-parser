[v1]
Even As the World began
the stars they sang and all the angels
Shouted for joy, shouted for joy
And looking back through history
Your people they have always had
A song they must sing
A song they must sing

[c]
All over the world Your song will resound
All over the world Your praises ring out
We’re living to see You’re name and renown
All over the world

[v2]
Young and old, near and far
There’s a place for ev’ry heart to
Join in your song, join in your song
And every nation tribe and tongue
Come together join as one
Give glory to God, glory to God

[v3]
Great is Your name
And great will be your song repeat
We lift up our hands and pray
We lift up our hands and pray
For holy is Your name

[e]
Your name, Your renown, are the desire of our souls
Your fame, Your glory, Your song,
