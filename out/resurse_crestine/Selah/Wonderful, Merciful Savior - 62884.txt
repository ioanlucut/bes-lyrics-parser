[v1]
Wonderful, Merciful, Savior
Precious Redeemer and Friend
Who would have thought that a Lamb could
Rescue the souls of man?
Oh You’ve rescued the souls of man

[v2]
Counselor, Comforter, Keeper
Spirit we long to embrace
You offer hope when our hearts have
Hopelessly lost our way
Oh we’ve hopelessly lost the way

[v3]
You are the One that we praise
You are the One that we adore
You give the healing and grace
Our hearts always hunger for
Oh our hearts always hunger for

[v4]
Almighty, infinite, Father
Faithfully loving Your own
Here in our weakness you’ll find us
Falling before Your throne
Oh we’re falling before Your Throne
