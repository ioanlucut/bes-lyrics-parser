[v1]
There is a beautiful terrible cross
Where though You committed no sin
Savior You suffered the most wicked fate
On the cruelest creation of men.

[c]
Yet on that beautiful terrible cross
You did what only You could
Turning that dark inspired evil of hell
Into our soulâ€™s greatest good.

[v2]
We see the love that You showed us
We see the live that You lost
We bow in wonder and praise You
For the beautiful terrible cross.

[v3]
There on that beautiful terrible cross
Though darkness was strong on that hill
You remained sovereign, Lord, still in control
As Your perfect plan was fulfilled.

[v4]
We gained the riches of heaven
Jesus You paid the horrible cost
We stand forgiven and praise You
For the beautiful terrible cross.

[e]
In the cross, in the cross
Be my glory ever
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.
